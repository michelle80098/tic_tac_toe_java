# Overview
I created a tic tac toe game in Java as a way of getting more comfortable with the language. I found that the syntax is somewhat close to the C# format. I found it useful to become familiar with the fundamental java syntax through various tutorials before beginning to code. This module has taught me how to use loops, classes, and variables in Java

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to improve this program by implenting a display of which player won
* I would like to display why it is an invalid move so the user is aware
* I would also like to add a feature where it will show who's turn it is
